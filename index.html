        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a creative and hard-working Information Technology student, anticipating graduation in June 2025. Through my internship experiences, I have gained hands-on skills in software development, web technologies, and data management, strengthening my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise.

          I am now ready to apply my knowledge in a professional setting and actively seeking job opportunities, internships, or part-time roles where I can contribute while continuing to grow. I am particularly interested in roles that involve web development, technical support, and software implementation, as they align with my experience and career goals. My adaptability and eagerness to learn drive me to take on new challenges, ultimately preparing me to become a well-rounded IT professional.</p>
